        <a href="https://scrapyard.hackclub.com/">Scrapyard</a> Minneapolis is a hardware hackathon organized by teens, for teens, happening on March 15-16.<br>
        It will be happening in <a href="https://tcmaker.org/">Twin Cities Maker</a>. Only people &lt;18 or in high school will be allowed at the event, however if you are outside of high school and interested in sponsoring, contact us at <a href="mailto:scrapyard-mpls@lunarhacks.space">scrapyard-mpls@lunarhacks.space</a>! For volunteering, continue reading...<br>
        <br> 
        <b>FAQ</b><br>
        <b>Q:</b> What's a hackathon? <b>A:</b> A hackathon is an event where a bunch of computer programmers(not hackers in the sterotypical sense, we won't be getting into anything illegal or anything we aren't supposed to!) get together for a set time and compete to program something based on a theme. A hardware hackathon(what this event is) is where the programmers', instead of only coding, also work to make something physically that is then programmed.<br>
        <b>Q:</b> How long is the event? <b>A:</b> 12-ish hours.<br>
        <b>Q:</b> Can I join virtually? <b>A:</b> No, sorry. To participate you have to come physically. If you are too far away, we can provide a travel stipend to pay for gas or a flight. Contact us with any questions at <a href="travel-scrapmpls@lunarhacks.space">travel-scrapmpls@lunarhacks.space</a>!<br>
        <b>Q:</b> Where do I sign up? <b>A:</b> A signup form is coming soon! Check back on this page later. You could also email us at <a href="mailto:scrapyard-mpls@lunarhacks.space">scrapyard-mpls@lunarhacks.space</a> to be alerted when signups open.<br>
        <b>Q:</b> What should I bring? <b>A:</b> Your laptop and a positive attitude! We will provide everything else.<br>
        <b>Q:</b> Can I be in a team? <b>A:</b> Yes! You can be in teams of up to four people, and if you don't know who you want to be with, join <a href="https://discord.gg/8e4QcSMCDX">the LunarHacks discord server</a>!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Volunteering</b><br>
        Volunteers would do jobs such as:<br>
        * Supervising attendees in places such as the 3d printer room, the electonics room, or in the classroom(main area where we will be)<br>
        * Providing help to attendees when requested<br>
        * Getting items from stores and/or restaurants<br>
        * Setting up food<br>
        * More!<br>
        When volunteering, you also wouldn't have to stay for the entire time.<br>
        We would like you to stay as long as you can, however there is no minimum time limit.<br>
        And we would also like people that know first aid/can perform CPR, so if anything mentioned above sounds interesting, contact us at <a href="mailto:volunteers-scrapmpls@lunarhacks.space">volunteers-scrapmpls@lunarhacks.space</a>!<br>
        If you volunteer, you will also get a free shirt, food, and a special badge identifying you as a volunteer that you can keep after the event!
